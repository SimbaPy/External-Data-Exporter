# External-Data-Exporter
I work for a beverage manufacturing company as a Production Analyst. My duties involve capturing stock data, comparing it with demand numbers (sales) and carrying out analysis of how much to produce. The software we use to do all this is currently facing challenges with importing data from the sql-erp tables. As such, my project is focused on going around the sql-erp tables.
